				In the wake of India’s military action on terror infrastructure and installations in Pakistan and Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had unveiled a new doctrine and framed it as part of the global war on terror. He made it clear that there will be no tolerance for terror that hides under “nuclear blackmail”, and no distinction would be made between the terrorists, their leaders and a government that sponsors them.
